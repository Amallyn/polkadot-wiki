Substrate-based chains, including the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, use an [SS58 encoding](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/External-Address-Format-(SS58)) for their address formats. This page serves as a registry for teams to see which chain corresponds to a given prefix, and which prefixes are availabe.

To claim a prefix, make a PR to the [registry](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/ss58-registry.json).
