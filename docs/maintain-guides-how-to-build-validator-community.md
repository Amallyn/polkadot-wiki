Validators are welcome to promote your node in the channels listed below or other social media platforms to let more people know about what is about your validator, what have you done for the network, why nominators should support your work. There are multiple ways to help you to get nominations from the community, for example, write a staking tutorial in a specific language that targets those communities, provide staking tooling to the community, etc..
