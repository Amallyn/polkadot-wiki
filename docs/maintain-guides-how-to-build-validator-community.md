Validators are welcome to promote their node in the channels listed below or other social media
platforms to let more people know about their validator stats, what they have done for the network,
and why nominators should support their work.

There are multiple ways to obtain nominations from the community, some of them being:

- Write a staking tutorial in a specific language that targets those communities
- Provide staking tooling to the community
- Help community members with understanding Polkadot on Telegram or Element, etc. to build up the
  reputation

Apart from getting nomination support from the community, you can join a thousand validators
programme created by the Web3 Foundation. Read
[here](https://polkadot.network/supporting-decentralization-join-the-polkadot-thousand-validators-programme/)
to know more about the details if you would like to run a validator on Kusama or Polkadot.
